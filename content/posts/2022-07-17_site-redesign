Quick note for anyone who visits my site while this old version is still up:

I'm migrating to a new design soon. My blog posts will be on Medium from now on (I've already ported the important ones), check it out here!

There's already a new post up that won't be published here. In the meantime, check out my GitHub for recent projects and statuses, or my Twitter, 
both linked in the header.

Sorry again for not being too active, uni and work have kept me super busy, and not using a proper CMS hasn't helped either :P
