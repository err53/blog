I recently tried to revamp my personal site to look a bit better.
It went alright, I guess, but it was just a bit off.

I came up with a nice and simple site design in Figma, based off of IBM's design theme.

For theming, Chakra UI was super nice to work with. 
I was able to quickly build out the design portion of my site, which I think looks alright, but not great.
I couldn't get it looking just the tiny bit better to make it look how I wanted though.

I also originally designed the site without intending to use Markdown, which was a terrible choice in hindsite.
I'm a big believer in modularity when designing programs, and having some kind of Markdown support should have been obvious.
Retrofiting MDX support into my site was difficult enough that I seriously switching away from Gatsby to Hugo.

However, the little things like Gatsby Link were nice to have, and instead of jumping back to Hugo, I decided to just go with a premade Gatsby theme for now.
(Surprisingly enough, this theme is pretty similar to what I had designed. Maybe I'll be able to take some inspiration from this...)

I'll definitely revisit a fully custom site for now, but given my limited time before post-secondary applications, I'll leave it like this for now.

Old blog posts will be uploaded shortly.
