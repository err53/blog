I keep forgetting that I have a blog, so here's an update on some stuff that's been hapening.

- I got into McMaster CS, and I'll be starting there this fall, so that's neat I guess.
- Against my better judgement, I built my first PC in the middle of the biggest GPU shortage the world has ever seen. (I'm working on a build video, stay tuned.)
- I've been working on and off at TakingITGlobal over the past year, and I've used some of my PWA chops to rebuild their RisingYouth grants site, and am currently working on some software under NDA as well.
  - I've also helped build a small, open-source React-based accessibility tool, called [a11ize](https://github.com/TakingITGlobal/a11ize), check it out!
- I designed my own logo a few months back in my last post, but managed to lose the source files cuz I'm an idiot. I think it looks pretty nice though so I'll probably do a similar design.
- My operating system hopping has gotten to the point where I just bought a Mac so I wouldn't fuck with my system every time I got a few days off. Honestly, I hate it a lot less than I thought I would.

Hopefully I'll think of some more longer form content in the future. Perhaps I'll write about my homelab setup someday (probably after TrueNAS SCALE gets out of beta).
