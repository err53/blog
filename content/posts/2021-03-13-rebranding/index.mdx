It's been a while since I've posted here. School's been busy, especially during the pandemic.
However, I feel like I should address the dramatic branding change I've been performing on many accounts.

## jhthenerd: Why you shouldn't let 10 year olds choose lasting usernames
I created my first real username when I was still in elementary. And boy was I cringe.
"Oh, let's put nerd in my username since I'm counterculture and think being a nerd is cool"
Man, was I dumb back then.

## error53: Apple, gaming, and (hopefully) a longer lasting username
I created the error53 tag after Apple's TouchID lockout fiasco.
I originally used it to separate my gaming identity from my personal one, but I don't really see the point these days.

## Logos and branding
I'm a fan of minimalist geometric design, so I took a crack at designing my own logo and iconography. For a first attempt, it came out surprisingly decent.
I'll probably change my mind on this down the line, but profile pictures are **much** easier to change than a username

## What's next?
I'm working on coming up with a coherent color scheme for my site. As much as I love grayscale, a splash of colour might make the site a bit more interesting.
