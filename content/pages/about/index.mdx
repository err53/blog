Hi! I'm Jason Huang.

I have been programming since ~2015. 
I primarily do frontend development, but have experience programming for backend. 
I also have a hobby of learning about SysAdmin and DevOps. 
I wouldn't call myself a full-stack developer, since I don't think I have enough experience to qualify as such just yet.

Aside from programming, I'm an advocate for Linux and OSS, and love to learn more about how the tools I use work. 
I'm also interested in compuiter security, and have been known to do the occasional CTF.

Check out some of my projects, or follow me on my socials. 
(I try not to use social media that much, so email is probably the best way to reach me.)
