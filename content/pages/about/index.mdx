Hi! I'm Jason Huang.

I have been programming since ~2015, and have been working in the industry since 2019.
I don't like the term full-stack developer, but I guess that best describes what I do.
I also have a hobby of learning about enterprise infrastructure and DevOps.

Aside from programming, I'm an advocate for Linux and OSS, and love to learn more about how the tools I use work. 
I'm also interested in computer security, and have been known to do the occasional CTF.

Check out some of my projects on Github, or follow me on my socials.
